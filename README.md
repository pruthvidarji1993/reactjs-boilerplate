## Sample React Structure 

One of the best features of the framework is how it lets you make most of the decisions around tooling, build tools and folder structures, and you should embrace that. I hope this structure will give you more flexiblity in terms of coding & help you to build larger React applications with proper format.

## Available Scripts

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.
Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

## Prerequisites 
* React ^16.14
* NODE
* axios ^0.19
* React Redux ^7.2.2

## Installation
#### 1. Clone this project or Download that ZIP file

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pruthvidarji1993/sample-structure.git
```

#### 2. Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed globally

More details [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


#### 3. On the command prompt run the following commands

```sh
$ cd `project-directory`
```
```sh
$ npm install
```

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.


By default, for build generate and deploy on server then.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.
